District Border calculations

Given a list of polygons, determine which edges are coincident, and produce a graph of border lines. The border lines should be extended as far as possible, so there are no colinear and contiguous border line segments.

All points are given as integers, but the integers can be arbitrarily large.
The polygons do not have to be convex, but they are not self intersecting.

Also find the perimeter polygon of the entire set of districts, and any interior holes.


A medium-difficulty example:

a----------b
|          |
c---d--e---f
|   |**|   |
g-h-i--j   |
| |     \  |
k-l------m-n

Key:
a-z are points
-, |, /, and \ are border lines
* are interior holes.

Input polygons:
abfc
cdig
efnmj
ghlk
hjml

Output:
border lines:
a-b
a-k
b-n
c-f
d-i
e-j
g-j
h-l
j-m
k-n

perimeter:
abnk

holes:
